## Content

### On Acceptance

We accept anyone's contributions based on its merits, regardless of identity, assuming the expected conduct outlined in this document is respected. We encourage seeing the positive side in participants - however, tolerating inappropriate behavior is not required.

### On Maturity and Reciprocity

We're all capable of acting like reasonable, rational people in collaborative spheres. Treat others like you want them to treat you.

### On Judgement

In Difference We Find Equality. No two people are the same, and yet we are all human at the end of the day. As such everyone deserves to be treated with equal respect and dignity, leaving social barriers behind us. Never should individuals be prejudiced on their traits or their identity. This project does not provide a place to shame or otherwise harass individuals for their differences, but rather to come together and leave them behind us for a common goal. While differences are implicit, inherent and often not up to us, our actions are not - we expect participants to behave with this in mind.

### On Division

Political activism outside the scope of this project and its goals leads to distraction, division and diversion from our primary mission, and as such has no place in this community. This project will not provide grounds for intentional aggression, politicization or other forms of subversion, infiltration, and division.

### On Enforcement

As part of behaving maturely, we expect you to be aware of the consequences you may face for acting inappropriately. It is up to the projects maintainers to handle violations on an individual basis.
