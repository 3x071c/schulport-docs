Hey everyone! This is the starting point of something wonderful.

### The Problem

Pupils at my school (the Louise-Schroeder-Gymnasium) can only access their substitution schedule and calendar over a website that's meant to be used by their parents. Since there's no other option, children can view the history and communicate with teachers in their parents name. In addition, the "Eltern-Portal" is missing features many pupils here would consider important, such as viewing recent homework or receiving updates conveniently over notifications in a single app instead of multiple channels.

### The solution

**Schulport** is a new, cross-platform app I've been developing together with my friend Moritz.
