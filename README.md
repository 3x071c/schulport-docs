# Schulport | Docs

This is the documentation for [schulport](https://github.com/3x071c/schulport), available [here](https://docs.schulport.com)

## Schulport

Schulport is a cross-platform application, written using [Web technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (a typed superset/compiler of JavaScript, the scripting language that powers most of the web), [React](https://reactjs.org/) (a declarative, component-based, reactive UI library), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) (a framework built around React), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)/[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) (a cross-platform hybrid web-app wrapper for native capabilities and native-feel components), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (a compiled, utility-first CSS framework) and [jotai](https://jotai.pmnd.rs/) (a React state management library). It enables pupils to conveniently check important dates, events, homework and their substitution schedule, with more to come.

## Development

### System Requirements

This app is written in JavaScript and utilizes [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) as a runtime. Some scripts included with this repository will probably not work on Windows ([m](https://tinyurl.com/nuub2bq)[y](https://tinyurl.com/y2emej63)[ ](https://tinyurl.com/y2lzznux)[c](https://tinyurl.com/y3v8vo5a)[o](https://tinyurl.com/y4qcfkw3)[n](https://tinyurl.com/y5gm9ysv)[d](https://tinyurl.com/y69uplwl)[o](https://tinyurl.com/yygc57ta)[l](https://tinyurl.com/yynoa7ql)[e](https://tinyurl.com/y3shavwn)[n](https://tinyurl.com/yxladmrj)[c](https://tinyurl.com/y3yxymqr)[e](https://tinyurl.com/y2c6alo5)[s](https://tinyurl.com/y5qtqr6p)). Make sure you have a recent `node` and `npm` version installed before proceeding (Install the latest non-LTS node version for development [here](https://nodejs.org/)).

### Environment

Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is **highly** recommended. Extensions and configurations are automatically applied, so linting and formatting will work effortlessly out-of-the-box.

### Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. **After downloading, initialize the project with `npm run new`**!
