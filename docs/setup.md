# Setup

## Install NodeJS

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), a server-side JavaScript runtime, is required to develop and run this project. It can be installed on their official website - we recommend the latest, non-LTS version for development. It should come with `npm`, the Node package manager, to install all dependencies of the project.

## Install pnpm

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is a special Node package manager which is faster and leaner on resources. Install it with `npm` over the command-line (on Windows: PowerShell, on macOS: iTerm, on Linux: Terminal): `npm i -g pnpm`.

## Install Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the editor we use and recommend for development. We have included settings and recommended extensions, making the initial setup easy.

## Install dependencies

Open this repository, which you have downloaded as .zip or cloned over git, in Visual Studio Code, then open the terminal (Ctrl + J) and run the following command: `pnpm i`

## You're all set!

Yay! \*\o/\*
