# Design

## First concept art

Originally, the project was written without Capacitor, ie without native functions, with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) instead of native Ionic Components. The original repository can still be found [here](https://github.com/lsglab/schuelerportal).

### Current version

The current version was built entirely with [Ionic components](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components).
